- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Muurein
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript for (sort of) the first time
- :v: The first project I'd like to create on my own is a small site where I can convert American baking measurments to Swedish ones, maybe even 
      a site that can convert whole recipes and find Swedish alternatives to American ingredients
- âš¡ Fun fact: right before December rolls around, I'll finally become a first-time cat owner to two kittens!
